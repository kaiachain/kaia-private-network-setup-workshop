### 2. Network architecture
>###### Full mesh connection should be made between CNs.
>###### So, You need to configure the firewall to allow ingress between nodes.

* For communication and multichannel between CN, allow TCP `32323-32324` and UDP `32323` to your firewall ingress rule.
* We will share CN node IPs for Pre-Mainnet configuration separately.
